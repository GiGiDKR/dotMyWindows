Okay, let's see what the user is dealing with here. They provided an app.manifest file and an error message when trying to run their application. The error is a Win32Exception with code 740, which mentions that the operation requires elevation. 

First, I remember that when an application needs administrator privileges, the manifest file has to specify that. In the provided manifest, the requestedExecutionLevel is set to "requireAdministrator". That should be correct because it's telling Windows that the app needs admin rights. But the error suggests that the process isn't starting with those privileges.

Wait, maybe the issue is how the application is being launched. The user is using 'dotnet run', which might not trigger the UAC prompt properly. When you run via 'dotnet run', the host process might not request elevation, even if the manifest says to require it. So the executable built by dotnet would have the manifest embedded, but the dotnet run command itself isn't elevated, causing the error.

So the solution would be to run the application directly as an administrator. That means building the project first and then executing the generated EXE with admin rights. Alternatively, the user could start Visual Studio or the terminal as administrator before running 'dotnet run', but that might not be ideal for development.

Another thing to check: sometimes the manifest might not be properly embedded into the executable. But the user's manifest looks correctly structured. The trustInfo section is there with requireAdministrator, so that's probably not the issue.

So the main plan is to adjust the execution method. The user needs to build the project and then run the EXE directly with admin privileges. Alternatively, they can run their IDE or terminal as admin to allow 'dotnet run' to elevate, but that's less secure and more intrusive.

I should present these options to the user, outlining the steps clearly. Let them choose which approach they prefer. If they go with running the EXE directly, the steps would involve building and then executing the file from the command line with elevation. If they prefer using 'dotnet run', they need to ensure the terminal is already elevated.

# Mode: PLAN  
**Problème identifié** : L'application nécessite des privilèges administrateur (via le manifeste) mais l'exécution via `dotnet run` échoue car l'élévation n'est pas déclenchée correctement.

**Plan proposé** :
1. Solution recommandée : Exécuter l'application via l'exécutable compilé plutôt que `dotnet run`
2. Alternative : Lancer le terminal/IDE en mode administrateur avant d'utiliser `dotnet run`

**Étapes nécessaires** :
```bash
# 1. Build du projet
dotnet build

# 2. Exécution directe de l'exécutable avec élévation
./bin/x64/Debug/net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0/win-x64/OhMyWindows.exe
```

Souhaitez-vous que je détaille l'une de ces solutions ou préférez-vous passer en mode ACT pour implémenter des ajustements ?
